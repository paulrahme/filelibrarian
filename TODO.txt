DONE:
- Basic functionality with command-line arguments
- Recursive reading in files
- Sort - by filename / dir name
- Change to prompt with command driven, implement quit function
- Help function, list function
- Sort by date modified, file size
- Command output / error
- Improve aliasing (quit/exit, etc) - currently need separate handling
- Initial export command - txt, csv
- Compare content across files - match or which lines are different. Also ignore blank lines (esp useful at end of file)
- Initial filter command - by matched substring in filename, matched content (string) inside file

TODO - Next:
- Tagging
- Saving + loading of current file list
- Saving + loading of query / command sequence (?)
- Export full comparison result matrix for all files
- Compare all against 1 specific file (how to specify - full path, or something less prone to human error?)


TODO / Ideas for later:
- Async commands
- WPF UI
